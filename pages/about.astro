    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-center">About Me</h1>

    <p class="mb-6">
      I'm a software engineer, red team enthusiast, and obsessive builder of systems that push both humans and machines to their limits. I come from a non-traditional background — no CS degree, no cookie-cutter path — just relentless curiosity, late nights, and an unshakable need to understand how things work (and how to break them).
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      By day, I write backend Java for a fintech company. By night, I build offensive security frameworks, compete on <strong>Hack The Box</strong> (currently ranked <em>Pro Hacker</em>), and architect open-source tools that blend elegance with raw capability. I'm driven by first-principles thinking and Clean Code discipline — not just getting things done, but doing them right.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Projects</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      I’m currently leading two major open-source builds:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Pentai</strong> — An operator-first, AI-augmented penetration testing framework. Terminal-native, tmux-aligned, with plugin support, finding manager, log integrity verification, and report generation. Designed to keep AI in the background and the human in charge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PleXion Framework</strong> — A modular, Spring-inspired Java application framework built from scratch. Includes REST, plugin lifecycle hooks, custom classloading, Undertow web support, and roadmap features like Netty, MVC, Hibernate, documentation generation, and even GraalVM native-image integration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Both projects are built around the same core principle: power without mystery. No black boxes, no magic. Just clean architecture, traceable flow, and hard-earned elegance.
    </p>

    <hr class="my-10 border-primary" />

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Red Team Focus</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I'm obsessed with offensive security — not for the chaos, but for the discipline. I’m steadily working toward a professional transition into a red team / pentesting role. I’ve been field-testing my own tooling (Pentai), writing structured HTB writeups, and actively sharpening my skills through real-world simulations. I take security seriously: from binary integrity checks to AI-augmented intel pipelines, everything I build is operator-first and adversary-resilient.
    </p>

    <hr class="my-10 border-primary" />

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Technical Stack</h2>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
      <li><strong>Java 17+</strong> — Backend dev, frameworks, concurrency, WildFly</li>
      <li><strong>Spring Boot</strong> — REST APIs, services, and integrations</li>
      <li><strong>Hibernate, Oracle, MySQL</strong> — Data access and optimization</li>
      <li><strong>Gson, Undertow, Netty</strong> — REST and reactive web layers</li>
      <li><strong>Python, Bash</strong> — Scripting, automation, CTF tooling</li>
      <li><strong>Vue.js, React.js</strong> — Frontend work when it needs doing</li>
      <li><strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Machine Learning & AI Engineering Certification</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="my-10 border-primary" />

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Values</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I believe in building things that matter — things that last. I care deeply about clean code, ethical engineering, real security, and making tools that elevate the operator instead of trying to replace them. I'm not here to be average. I'm here to master the craft.
    </p>

    <p class="italic text-accent text-center mt-12">
      If it doesn't make me sharper or stronger, I don't ship it.
